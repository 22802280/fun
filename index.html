            <p>Penises are born ready, and it is commonTrusted Source for babies to exit the womb with an erection. Even before the moment of birth, ultrasound scans sometimes show a fetus with a fully formed erection. According to a study from 1991, fetal erections most commonly occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. And they can happen a number of times each hour. No one is quite sure why, but it might be the body’s way of testing things out and keeping them running correctly.</p>
            <h3>2. A penis is twice as long as you think</h3>
            <p>A lot of people might take solace in this fact: Penises are longer than they look. In fact, around half of the entire length is housed inside the body.</p>
